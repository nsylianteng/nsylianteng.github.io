    <p class="story">
    We live in one physical world. But we really live in the little worlds in our heads, don’t we? Like bubbles that we see the world through. Or a cloud of stuff like Pig Pen in Peanuts. But instead of the haze of dust at his feet, it’s a cloud of ideas around our heads. When we connect with someone, it’s our bubbles that are connecting. If we are lucky, 80 to 90 percent of our bubbles overlap (because 100 percent is never really possible) and they are who we call our people. When a group of people get together, their bubbles combine into a bigger one. When this bubble gets big enough, it becomes what we call reality.
    So when you feel like the only one who thinks and feels the way you do, know that there's someone on the other side of the world with the same bubble as you. I often wonder what you can do to help them find you.</p>
